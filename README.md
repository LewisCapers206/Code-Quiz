# Code-Quiz

I was able to go back and re-do this assignment, at first this was difficult for me to do but I was able to finish it this time around. I had to look around and do some research in able to get it right this time.
I belive that slowly but surely I am progressing and getting better with JS, overtime I have been able to learn and understand it much more.
